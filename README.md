# React Native State Update Issue: Unexpected Behavior Outside Component Scope

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development where attempts to modify component state from outside the component's scope leads to unexpected behavior. The issue arises because React's state management system is tied to component re-rendering.  Modifying state externally prevents React from triggering the necessary UI updates.

## Bug Description

The `UnexpectedStateUpdate.js` file showcases a function attempting to directly update a component's state. This approach is flawed as it bypasses React's internal state management, resulting in the UI not reflecting the state changes.

## Solution

The `UnexpectedStateUpdateSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation. Instead of directly accessing and modifying the state variable, it employs the proper `setState` method (or the equivalent functional state update for functional components). This allows React to track the changes and update the UI appropriately.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`).
5. Observe the incorrect behavior in the original file and the correct behavior in the solution file.
